        <h1>About LUWI Foundation</h1>
        <p>LUWI Foundation is dedicated to raising awareness on intersex and sexual health issues among students in Zambia. We have reached over 1,000 students, partnered with the Intersex Society of Zambia and Zambian Royal Medical University, and organized countless impactful events. Our programs aim to empower students with knowledge, reduce stigma, and provide a platform for testimonies and open discussion.</p>

        <p>Our work continues because of generous donors who believe in supporting education, health awareness, and student empowerment. Even small contributions help us reach more students and create lasting change in communities.</p>

        <p>Currently, we also run awareness programs in colleges and universities, addressing the unique struggles students face today, including mental health, sexual health, and access to reliable information.</p>
