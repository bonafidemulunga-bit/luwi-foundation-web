        <h1>About LUWI Foundation</h1>

        <p>LUWI Foundation is a student-focused organization dedicated to raising awareness on intersex and sexual health issues across Zambia. Our mission is to empower students with accurate information, reduce stigma, and provide support for their unique challenges.</p>

        <p>Since our inception, we have:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Visited more than five schools so far.</li>
            <li>Reached over 1,000 students through workshops and awareness programs.</li>
            <li>Formed partnerships with organizations such as the Intersex Society of Zambia, the Sports Impact Network, and Zambian Royal Medical University.</li>
            <li>Organized numerous events across communities and educational institutions.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Our programs are informed by students’ testimonies and real-life experiences. We aim to create safe spaces for open discussion and learning. As a lecturer at Zambian Royal Medical University, I also contribute to bridging the gap between academic knowledge and practical awareness among students.</p>

        <p>LUWI Foundation’s work continues because of generous donors who help us sustain and expand our outreach. Your support allows us to reach more students, empower young people, and address urgent sexual health challenges.</p>
